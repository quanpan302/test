## Sencha Cmd

Using Sencha Cmd with Ext JS 6 [link](https://docs.sencha.com/cmd/guides/extjs/cmd_app.html#extjs-_-cmd_app_-_building_your_application)

### Cmd Generate

* Help
  
	`sencha help generate`
  
	```
	Sencha Cmd v6.5.3.6
	sencha generate

	This category contains code generators used to generate applications as well
	as add new classes to the application.

	Commands
		* app - Generates a starter application
		* controller - Generates a Controller for the current application
		* form - Generates a Form for the current application (Sencha Touch Specific)
		* model - Generates a Model for the current application
		* package - Generates a starter package
		* profile - Generates a Profile for the current application (Sencha Touch Specific)
		* theme - Generates a theme page for slice operations (Ext JS Specific)
		* view - Generates a View for the current application (Ext JS Specific)
		* workspace - Initializes a multi-app workspace
	```

* Generating Application
  
	`sencha -sdk /path/to/ext6 generate app MyApp /path/to/myApp`
  
	`sencha generate app -ext MyApp /path/to/myApp`
  
* Generating Models
  
	`sencha generate model Personnel id:name,email,phone`
  
* Generating Views
  
	`sencha generate view login.Login`
  
	```
	app/
		view/
			login/                  # Folder for the classes implementing the new view
				Login.js            # The new view
				LoginModel.js       # The `Ext.app.ViewModel` for the new view
				LoginController.js  # The `Ext.app.ViewController` for the new view
	```
  
* Generating Controllers
  
	In Ext JS 5+,
	each view generated by Sencha Cmd has a default Ext.app.ViewController.

	So it is not necessary to generate global controllers based on Ext.app.Controller in most cases.

	If you need a new controller, you can generate one in the same basic way as with Models and Views

	`sencha generate controller Login`

[_Back to TOC_](#table-of-contents)

### Cmd Build

* Help
  
	`sencha help app`

	```
	Sencha Cmd v6.5.3.6
	sencha app

	This category contains various commands for application management.

	Commands
		* build - Executes the build process for an application
		* clean - Cleans the application for a build
		* emulate - Builds the application via a Packager then executes in the simulator/emulator
		* explain - Resolves a reference path from the application's entry file to the specified symbol
		* init - Initializes the current directory as a Sencha Cmd application.
		* install - Repopulate the missing pieces of a Sencha Cmd app scaffold
		* prepare - Builds the application then the Packager prepares the app for native build (cordova only)
		* publish - Publishes an application version to Sencha Web Application Manager.
		* refresh - Updates the application metadata (aka "bootstrap") file
		* run - Builds the application via a Packager then executes the on a device
		* upgrade - Upgrade the current application to the specified SDK
		* watch - Watches an application for file system changes and rebuilds.
	```
  
* Building Your Application
  
	`sencha app build`
  
* Development Mode
  
	`sencha app watch`
  
* Development Builds and Refresh
  
	`sencha app build development`
  
	`sencha app refresh`

## Sencha Structure

[app.json](app.json)

Ext JS applications follow a unified directory structure that is the **same** for every app.

In our recommended layout, all **Store, Model, ViewModel, and ViewController classes** are placed in the `app` folder.

* Models placed in the `model` folder
* Stores in `store`
* ViewModels/Controllers in `view`

> Best practice
> Logically group **ViewControllers** and **ViewModels** together in sub-folders within the `app/view/` folder.
> Using a similar naming structure that you'll use for the views themselves.
> (see the "app/view/main/" and "classic/src/view/main/" folders below).

### Folder Overrides

```
overrides/                      # JavaScript code that is automatically required
```

The contents of "overrides" folders are automatically required and included in
builds. These should not be explicitly mentioned in "requires" or "uses" in code.
This area is intended for overrides like these:

    Ext.define('MyApp.overrides.foo.Bar', {
        override: 'Ext.foo.Bar',
        ...
    });

Such overrides, while automatically required, will only be included if their target
class ("Ext.foo.Bar" in this case) is also required. This simplifies applying
patches or extensions to other classes.

## Sencha Help

`sencha`

```
Sencha Cmd v6.5.3.6
Sencha Cmd provides several categories of commands and some global switches. In
most cases, the first step is to generate an application based on a Sencha SDK
such as Ext JS or Sencha Touch:

    sencha -sdk /path/to/sdk generate app MyApp /path/to/myapp

Sencha Cmd supports Ext JS 4.1.1a and higher and Sencha Touch 2.1 and higher.

To get help on commands use the help command:

    sencha help generate app

For more information on using Sencha Cmd, consult the guides found here:

http://docs.sencha.com/cmd/
