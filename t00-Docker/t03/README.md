# Get Started, Part 4

[Swarms](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part4/)

**Understanding Swarm clusters**

A swarm is a group of machines that are running Docker and joined into a cluster.
After that has happened, you continue to run the Docker commands you’re used to,
but now they are executed on a cluster by a **swarm manager**.
The machines in a swarm can be physical or virtual.
After joining a swarm, they are referred to as **nodes**.
