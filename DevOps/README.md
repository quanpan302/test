# DevOps

## Wikipedia

[**DevOps**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) (a clipped compound of "development" and "operations") is a software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software development `(Dev)` and software operation `(Ops)`.

The main **characteristic** of the DevOps movement is to strongly advocate automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction, from integration, testing, releasing to deployment and infrastructure management.

*DevOps aims at shorter development cycles, increased deployment frequency, more dependable releases, in close alignment with business objectives.*
